This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

The tutorial asked me to write a bit about myself. I am a Notre Dame student majoring in Business Analytics and Spanish, minoring in Marketing and the Business Honors Program. I play Ultimate Frisbee, work in the Writing Center, and in the Center for Research Computing.
